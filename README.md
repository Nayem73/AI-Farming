## AI-Farming AI Models and Accuracy

- Our AI-Farming platform currently supports disease prediction for 5 plant species, encompassing 21 distinct diseases.

- During **development phase**, the five AI models achieved an accuracy rate of **99%**.

- In the current **real-world deployment** phase, these models exhibit an average accuracy of **98.5%**.
